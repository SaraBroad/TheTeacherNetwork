# TheTeacherNetwork

The Teacher Network is a website that connects Philadelphia school teachers with the community and the community with school teachers.  On the teacher side, this site is intended to be a resource for teachers to use to obtain supplies, connect with community organizations and corporations, and to provide a forum to exchange ideas between teachers and community members. On the community/corporation sides, businesses and organizations can offer extra supplies and let teachers know what resources, like internships or community partnerships, are available to teachers.

This site is inspired by my experience as a Philadelphia school teacher and the experiences of my colleagues. I am joining forces with a close friend/colleague who has many years of experience connecting the community with the classroom. Given the current news about the lack of resources and funding for teachers, it is more important than ever for the community and schools to work together to support our teachers.

More information coming soon.
